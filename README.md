# JavaLobby
Simple TCP multiplayer lobby system -

The primary purpose of this project is to enable myself to speed up my ability to prototype
multiplayer related things. 

Hopefully by the time this project is finished I should have an easy to interface with lobby.

More README will be added as the project develops.
